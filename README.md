Chatbot Using Python:
This project demonstrates the development of a simple chatbot using Python. The chatbot is designed to simulate a conversational interface that responds to user input based on predefined patterns.

Features:
1: Text-based Interaction: The chatbot accepts user input via text and responds accordingly.
2: Pattern Matching: It uses basic string matching to identify key phrases or words from the user and provides predefined responses.
3: Simple Structure: Easy to understand and extend with more sophisticated responses or logic.

How It Works:
1: The user inputs a message in the chat interface (or terminal).
2: The chatbot processes the message and looks for specific keywords or phrases.
3: Based on these keywords, the chatbot responds with a predefined message.
